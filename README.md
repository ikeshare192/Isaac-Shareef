# Predicting circulating temperatures in a horizontal wellbore while drilling.
This is a model that uses regression analysis to predict and model circulating temperatures in a horizontal wellborn while drilling.
It uses real world data where certain variables were held constant and others were changed.  Through the use of regression analysis 
this model can be used as a prototype to predict circulating temperatures in drilling operations where the basin temperatures
are elevated.
